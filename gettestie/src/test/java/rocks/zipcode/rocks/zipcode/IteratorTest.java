//The hasNext() method can be used for checking if there's at least one element left to iterate over.
    @Test
    public void nextTest(){}
//    The next() method can be used for stepping over the next element and obtaining it:


    @Test
    public void removeTest(){}
//remove the current element from the collection


    @Test
    public void hasPreviousTest(){}
//ListIterator can be used for backward traversal so it provides equivalents of hasNext() and next():
    @Test
    public void previousTest(){}

    @Test
    public void nextIndexTest(){}
//Additionally, we can traverse over indices and not actual elements:
    @Test
    public void previousIndexTest(){}

@Test
    public void addTest(){}
//The add method, which, as the name suggests, allows us to add an element before the item that would be returned by next() and after the one returned by previous():
    @Test
    public void setTest(){}
//    The last method worth mentioning is set(), which lets us replace the element that was returned in the call to next() or previous():
